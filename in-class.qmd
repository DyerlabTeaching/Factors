1. Change the order of the weekdays to start with Monday.
2. Add two additional factor columns:
  - Weekday/Weekend based on the day of the week.
  - Create a column based upon the *four primary lunar phases* for the data collected.
3. [Superstar Question] Create a column that is a factor indicating if the tide is coming in (Incoming) or going out (Outgoing).

Upload a markdown document that shows summaries of these changes in the Rice Rivers Center data set.
